# win32
Collection of programs written with win32 mostly in C/C++.

## cube
A simple program that I wrote using GDI that sort of looks like a cube.

## graph
The first Win32 Program that I wrote for Assignment 1 in the Programming module in the Automation and Mechatronics Systems (AMS) course in my time in the school of engineering. Hope to improve in the future.

## readbitmapwin32
A simple program to piece together bitmaps into a .ico file. Does not work with bitmaps with bit depth of <=8. Hope to improve in the future.

## windowclassinfo
A simple program to list the information of the window for people still willing to write GUIs using unmanaged code.

## client
A simple concept to create a server-client relationship between two different processes running on two different languages. A layer between C# and C/C++ created using Explicit PInvoke and Marshalling arguements with C/C++ dllexport subroutines and functions using Win32. 

Marshalling Arguements: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/calling-native-functions-from-managed-code?view=msvc-170 

Explicit PInvoke: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/using-explicit-pinvoke-in-cpp-dllimport-attribute?view=msvc-170

## monitorinfo
A simple program to get monitorinfo to get the width and height of the monitor to simulate a maximized application.

## unicode_to_utf16
A simple program to translate unicode block to UTF-16 encoding. Good for manual encoding of UTF-16 for a few characters in a program, not good for large paragraphs of characters. Hope to write a program that covers that area of weakness with addition to other functionalities.

## tool
A simple program that aids me in writing win32 programs.

## python-proto
A python extension that aids me in developing UIs.
