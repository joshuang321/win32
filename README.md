Collection of programs written with win32.

## cube
A simple program that I wrote using GDI that sort of looks like a cube.

## graph
The first Win32 Program that I wrote for Assignment 1 in the Programming module in the Automation and Mechatronics Systems (AMS) course in my time in the school of engineering. Hope to improve in the future.

## readbitmapwin32
A simple program to piece together bitmaps into a .ico file. Does not work with bitmaps with bit depth of <=8. Hope to improve in the future.

## windowclassinfo
A simple program to list the information of the window for people still willing to write GUIs using unmanaged code.

## client
A simple concept to create a server-client relationship between two different processes running on two different languages. A layer between C# and C/C++ created using Explicit PInvoke and Marshalling arguements with C/C++ dllexport subroutines and functions using Win32.
